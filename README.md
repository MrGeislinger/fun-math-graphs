# Just Some Fun Math Graphs

Got inspired from [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile) on YouTube. Specifically 
the video with Neil Sloane's ["Amazing Graphs"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAMgUB51XZA&feature=youtu.be)

If you haven't seen checked out Numberphile before, you're in for a mathematical treat!
